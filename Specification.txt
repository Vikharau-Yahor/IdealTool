Requirements:

CONFIG GENERATION
- Scan for all projects in a folder and collect: git repos, type of project (.net, other), type of .net project (exe, dll), .sln path, main proj path and etc -- save all into the config
- Every project must have key/alias (user input)
- Collect tools info (VS, Rider, PS, VSCode, [optional]Sublime)

Config xml:
<Project type=dotNet subtype=web alias=io genId=IntelliWeb.csproj >


NetProjects:
<Sln isInGit="true/false" path="" name="">
<NetProject //.net consoles, wpf, asp, win-services and etc
	isInGit="true/false" 
	projPath="sln relative path" 
	name="IntellifentOffice.csproj"
	alias="io"
	genId="IntellifentOffice.csproj"
	type="webapp"
	custom="false" // Is this project generated by tool or added by user
	role=""
<\Sln>
<OtherProject custom=> //non .net but in github

PROJECTS ACTIONS
- .net project: open in vs or other tool + build (+ restore nuget) sln/main proj + run exe

- [optional or it's not necessary] create global storage of keys (for restoring short cuts and any hand-inputed info for re-generated projects config), so every project will have two keys: user's shortcut and autogenerated identifier (e.g. name of solution)



PROBLEMS:
* Store different types of project
* Store multiple projects for net solution with several alive (eg. io repo: server.core, web, server.valuations, tests)
